                    <p>The ultimate purpose of the program is to help users optimize their time by finding climbing areas based on their preferences.</p>

                    <p>By combining metrics such as distance to user, 
type/difficulty of routes, and concentration of routes, we can find 
where climbers can make best use of their time. MP lets users search by a
 variety of different metrics, including route quality, number of 
pitches, route type, and difficulty, as well as by geographic location. 
This approach has limitations. This program not only improves upon some 
of these metrics, such as the way that route quality is measured, but 
also adds new functionality.</p>
                    <h3>Web Scraper</h3>
                    <img class="row-img" src="Projects_files/database.png">
                    <p>The first step of the process is to create a 
database of route information. Mountain Project is organized into areas 
and routes, with most of the important information on the routes page.  I
 still had to keep track of which routes were in which areas, so I 
created an SQL database with one table for route level pages and another
 for area level pages.</p>
                    <p>Routes are obviously what I was mostly interested
 in, so I grabbed the name, url, rating, location, type of climb, grade 
of climb, and length for each route, then gave each a unique id.</p>
                    <p>Since climbing ratings are different depending on
 the type of climbing and the location, I also converted the ratings 
into a linear system, 0 being the easiest rating for a style and moving 
up as the routes got harder.  For example, there are 77 different 
possible Yosemite Decimal System (YDS) ratings on Mountain project, so 
the easiest would be a 0 and the hardest a 76.</p>
                    <p>At this stage, I also preprocessed the text for 
each route.  Each route has a name, most have descriptions, and some 
have user comments.  I wanted to try to categorize routes based on the 
type of terrain by looking at this text, something that Mountain Project
 doesn’t do yet.  To get the text ready to analyze, I combined these 
three sources of user-input into one block of text, then standardized 
and tokenized it, removed  stop words, and ran it through a Porter 
stemmer.  I held all of the words and the id of the route they pertained
 to in another table of my database.</p>
                    <h3>Bayesian Rating System</h3>
                    <p>After scraping the routes I needed, I analyzed 
the data.  I wanted to improve the way route quality was measured, as 
the current star-system ust gave each route its average rating.  I 
decided to use Bayesian statistics to get a more accurate measure.</p>
                    <p>The drawbacks of using the simple average are 
that highly rated routes with only a few ratings tend to appear higher 
than they should and routes with no user-ratings are shunted to the 
bottom of the list.</p>
                    <p>My Bayesian rating system helps to mitigate these
 effects.  The weighted rating works by first finding the average rating
 for all routes and adding a number of “phantom voters” who all rate the
 route as average.  For routes with only a few ratings, the effect is to
 dramatically revert towards the mean, but as more people rate it, this 
effect lessens.</p>

                    <h3>Clustering</h3>
                    <p>By clustering routes based on geographic area and
 similarity of styles, this program helps to promote routes that are 
near other routes similar to them. This helps by ignoring routes that 
are exactly what you want - but 50 miles from any other route you might 
want to do.</p>
                    <h3>Terrain</h3>
                    <p>Climbers often have a type of route - e.g. 
overhangs, slab, cracks - that they like more than others. Using natural
 language processing of route descriptions and comments, this program 
attempts to categorize each climb into one or more of these terrain 
styles. This is another metric by which users can select their preferred
 type of climbing.</p>
                    <h3>Styles</h3>
                    <p>MP's search function only allows users to search 
by one climbing style at a time - bouldering, sport, etc. This program 
allows users to select any number of routes that they like, and finds 
the best areas that have any of these styles. For example, I may enjoy 
sport climbing and bouldering, and would want to find nearby areas that 
have either. Additionally, in general the grade people can climb changes
 depending on the type of route, and this function allows users to 
specify grade in a style-specific way.</p>
