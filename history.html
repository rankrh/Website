My main duties there were to research thought leaders in the arts in preparation for a global conference held annually in Abu Dhabi.  As part of the research, we created a database of important cultural icons, which I helped take the lead in cleaning, organizing, and maintaining.  I also took the initiative to automate reports and create data visualizations with Excel, and was often the point-person for colleagues who needed help with the software.</p>

                            <p>I graduated from William and Mary in May 2017 with degrees in chemistry and music, concentrating in organic chemistry and jazz guitar performance.  I liked studying with each half of my brain in a completely different world because of the unexpected connections you can find.  Organic chemistry fine-tuned my problem solving ability by making me work with small pieces of information that have to be built together to create something new, whether that be an organic molecule or a programming script.  Studying music was a nice distraction, but also taught me about the value of practicing - over and over again until something is exactly the way you want it.</p>

Working with a team of 8, we tackled ecological restoration initiatives in National Forests and Wildlife refuges throughout Oregon and Washington. A large part of what we did was finding, documenting, and removing invasive species, but we also planted a lot of trees as part of reforestation efforts.  We worked with experts from the Department of the Interior and Department of Agriculture who taught us first-hand principles in modern forest ecology. A lot of the time my team and I worked in isolated, backcountry settings, which made us solve problems and interpret job guidelines without direct supervision. </p>

                            <h1>August 2017 - January 2019, Sterling, VA</h1>
                            <p>Climbing is one of my main hobbies, and I worked intermittently as a climbing instructor at Sportrock Climbing Centers in Sterling, Virginia.  I taught climbing techniques and technical skills to people who had never climbed before and to advanced climbers.  You have to be very encouraging and understanding of people’s fears and self doubts when you’re working with new climbers - it’s a skill that doesn’t come naturally to a lot of people.  As an instructor, I helped kids and adults tackle their fears in a controlled and fun way.  And of course I got to climb a lot, which was a huge perk.</p>

                            <p>My first AmeriCorps position was teaching kids about nature and the environment.  I taught classes on environmental issues like pollinator loss and on outdoor skills like orienteering.  The classes were free and open to the public, so I worked with people of all ages, from groups of elementary schoolers to retirees.  Some of the lessons I taught had already been written, but I also researched, wrote, and created lesson materials for new programs.  Some of my favorite programs that I ran were the night owl hike - a 10 p.m. jaunt through the woods with an owl call and a flashlight -  and emergency fire-starting - where I showed people how to start campfires with magnifying glasses, soda cans, and flint and steel.</p>

                            <p>I was in charge of setting new climbing routes and peforming routine maintenance at the climbing wall at William and Mary's gym.  I managed a team of ten setters, coordinated schedules, and trained new employees in technical skills and safety policies. We set new rock climbing routes twice a week, maintaining an interesting and fun collection of climbs.  I liked the technical challenge and spatial thinking required, as well as the creative process of making a good climbing route.</p>
